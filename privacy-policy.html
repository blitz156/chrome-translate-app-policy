    <h1>Privacy Policy for Quick Translator</h1>
    <p>Last updated: March 28, 2025</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Quick Translator is designed to respect your privacy while providing translation services. Here's how we handle your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We only process the text you specifically select for translation</li>
        <li>We store your preferred language settings locally in your browser</li>
        <li>We do not collect or store any personal information</li>
        <li>We do not track your browsing history or activities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>When you use Quick Translator:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selected text is sent to translation service providers only for the purpose of translation</li>
        <li>No selected text or translations are stored on our servers</li>
        <li>All settings are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our extension requires minimal permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your language preferences locally</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The extension uses content scripts to provide translation functionality on web pages, which does not require additional permissions.</p>
